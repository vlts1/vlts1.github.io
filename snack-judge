Snack Judge values your privacy. This app does not collect or share any personal data with third parties. All features run entirely on your device.

What We Collect
Snack Judge does not collect or transmit any personal information to external servers. However, the following data is stored locally on your device:

Camera Access
Snack Judge uses your device’s camera only to scan barcodes. No images or video are recorded, stored, or transmitted.

Third-Party Services
Snack Judge uses the Open Food Facts API to retrieve nutritional data for scanned barcodes. Only the barcode value is sent, and no personal or device-identifiable information is included.
